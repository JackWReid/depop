# Depop RoboPop
What makes any given item worthy of the Depop Explore feed? We're trying to teach a machine learning model what the gold dust is. This tool allows us to look at a list of products and see what the model's guess at the popability is. It allows us to see how the model is doing.

## Setup
1. `yarn`
2. `npm start`
